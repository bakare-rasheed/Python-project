# Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- GitHub Account: You need an active GitHub account to access the GitHub API and to create repositories.

- Python and Pip: Ensure that Python (version 3.x) is installed on your system, along with pip, the package installer for Python.

# Installation
- Create a Repository
- Clone the Repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repo-name with the name of your repository.

# Navigate to the Repository Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate into the cloned repository's directory:

`cd repos`

# Install the requests Library:

Use pip to install the requests library, which is required for making API calls:

`pip install requests`

# Create Project Files:

Inside the cloned repository directory on your local machine
create a new Python file (`list_projects.py`) and paste your API call code into it.

# Test Locally:

Test your code locally to ensure that it works as expected. Run the script using `python list_projects.py` in your terminal.

# Git Add, Commit, and Push:

Use Git commands to stage, commit, and push your code to the GitHub repository.
